# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to present data through interactive maps.  In this project, we used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, whereas a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

    •	Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
    •	Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
    •	Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
    •	Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
    •	Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
    •	Render maps on a local server.
   
The assignment we created required an earthquake map with two different maps and an earthquake overlay. Also, we had to create earthquake data related to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, establish a map with all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and create a third map.
